Timing schedules are used for specifying when events are expected or requested to occur, and may also be used to represent the summary of a past or ongoing event.  For simplicity, the definitions of Timing components are expressed as 'future' events, but such components can also be used to describe historic or ongoing events.\n\nA Timing schedule can be a list of events and/or criteria for when the event happens, which can be expressed in a structured form and/or as a code. When both event and a repeating specification are provided, the list of events should be understood as an interpretation of the information in the repeat structure.","min":0,"max":"*","mapping":[{"identity":"v2","map":"N/A"},{"identity":"rim","map":"QSET<TS> (GTS)"}]},{"id":"Timing.event","path":"Timing.event","short":"When the event occurs","definition":"Identifies specific times when the event occurs.","requirements":"In a Medication Administration Record, for instance, you need to take a general specification, and turn it into a precise specification.","min":0,"max":"*","type":[{"code":"dateTime"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"QLIST<TS>"}]},{"id":"Timing.repeat","path":"Timing.repeat","short":"When the event is to occur","definition":"A set of rules that describe when the event is scheduled.","requirements":"Many timing schedules are determined by regular repetitions.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Element"}],"constraint":[{"key":"tim-9","severity":"error","human":"If there's an offset, there must be a when (and not C, CM, CD, CV)","expression":"offset.empty() or (when.exists() and ((when in ('C' | 'CM' | 'CD' | 'CV')).not()))","xpath":"not(exists(f:offset)) or exists(f:when)"},{"key":"tim-5","severity":"error","human":"period SHALL be a non-negative value","expression":"period.exists() implies period >= 0","xpath":"f:period/@value >= 0 or not(f:period/@value)"},{"key":"tim-6","severity":"error","human":"If there's a periodMax, there must be a period","expression":"periodMax.empty() or period.exists()","xpath":"not(exists(f:periodMax)) or exists(f:period)"},{"key":"tim-7","severity":"error","human":"If there's a durationMax, there must be a duration","expression":"durationMax.empty() or duration.exists()","xpath":"not(exists(f:durationMax)) or exists(f:duration)"},{"key":"tim-8","severity":"error","human":"If there's a countMax, there must be a count","expression":"countMax.empty() or count.exists()","xpath":"not(exists(f:countMax)) or exists(f:count)"},{"key":"tim-1","severity":"error","human":"if there's a duration, there needs to be duration units","expression":"duration.empty() or durationUnit.exists()","xpath":"not(exists(f:duration)) or exists(f:durationUnit)"},{"key":"tim-10","severity":"error","human":"If there's a timeOfDay, there cannot be a when, or vice versa","expression":"timeOfDay.empty() or when.empty()","xpath":"not(exists(f:timeOfDay)) or not(exists(f:when))"},{"key":"tim-2","severity":"error","human":"if there's a period, there needs to be period units","expression":"period.empty() or periodUnit.exists()","xpath":"not(exists(f:period)) or exists(f:periodUnit)"},{"key":"tim-4","severity":"error","human":"duration SHALL be a non-negative value","expression":"duration.exists() implies duration >= 0","xpath":"f:duration/@value >= 0 or not(f:duration/@value)"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"Implies PIVL or EIVL"}]},{"id":"Timing.repeat.bounds[x]","path":"Timing.repeat.bounds[x]","short":"Length/Range of lengths, or (Start and/or end) limits","definition":"Either a duration for the length of the timing schedule, a range of possible length, or outer bounds for start and/or end limits of the timing schedule.","min":0,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Duration"},{"code":"Range"},{"code":"Period"}],"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"IVL(TS) used in a QSI"}]},{"id":"Timing.repeat.count","path":"Timing.repeat.count","short":"Number of times to repeat","definition":"A total count of the desired number of repetitions across the duration of the entire timing specification.
