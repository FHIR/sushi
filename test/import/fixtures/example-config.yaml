# This IG YML file is inspired by the ImplementationGuide resource
# and also draws from package.json, package-list.json, and ig.ini.
# That said, it is structured for ease-of-use, so it is not strictly
# conformant to any of those existing configuration formats.

# SUSHI will use id as both id and packageId in the IG unless a
# specific packageId is also provided in this file.

# it can be a single item OR and array here (but so far SUSHI only
# support 4.0.1 anyway).
fhirVersion: 4.0.1

# The template property will be copied into the ig.ini file.
# To provide a custom ig.ini file, do not include this property and
# include an `ig.ini` file in ig-data.
template: hl7.fhir.template#0.0.5

# The following two lines correspond to items that used to be in
# ig.ini but were recently moved to IG.definition.parameter. For
# consistency within this file, the names are represented using
# camelcase, but if authors use the formal parameter names, SUSHI
# will recognize them as well. In either case, they'll be copied
# to the IG JSON using the formal names.

# The jurisdiction can be a single item or a list. The FHIR Shorthand
# code syntax can be used here.
jurisdiction: urn:iso:std:iso:3166#US "United States of America"

# The dependencies property corresponds to IG.dependsOn. The key is the
# package id and the value is the version (or dev/current).
dependencies:
  hl7.fhir.us.core: 3.1.0

# The global property corresponds to the IG.global property, but it
# uses the type as the YAML key and the profile as its value. Since
# FHIR does not explicitly disallow more than one profile per type,
# neither do we; the value can be a single profile URL or an array
# of profile URLs.
global:
  Patient: http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/my-patient-profile
  Encounter: http://example.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/my-encounter-profile

# The resources property corresponds to IG.definition.resource.
# SUSHI can auto-generate all of the resource entries based on
# the FSH definitions and/or information in any user-provided
# JSON resource files. If the generated entries are not
# sufficient or complete, however, the author can add entries
# here. If the reference matches a generated entry, it will
# replace the generated entry. If it doesn't match any generated
# entries, it will be added to the generated entries. The format
# follows IG.definition.resource with the following differences:
#   * use IG.definition.resource.reference.reference as the YAML key
#   * specify "omit" to omit a FSH-generated resource from the
#     resource list.
#   * groupingId can be used, but top-level groups syntax may be a
#     better option (see below).
# The following are simple examples to demonstrate what this might
# look like:
resources:
  Patient/my-example-patient:
    name: My Example Patient
    description: An example Patient
    exampleBoolean: true
  Patient/bad-example: omit

# Groups can control certain aspects of the IG generation.  The IG
# documentation recommends that authors use the default groups that
# are provided by the templating framework, but if authors want to
# use their own instead, they can use the mechanism below.  This will
# create IG.definition.grouping entries and associate the individual
# resource entries with the corresponding groupIds.
groups:
  GroupA:
    description: The Alpha Group
    resources:
    - StructureDefinition/animal-patient
    - StructureDefinition/arm-procedure
  GroupB:
    description: The Beta Group
    resources:
    - StructureDefinition/bark-control
    - StructureDefinition/bee-sting

# The pages property corresponds to IG.definition.page. SUSHI can
# auto-generate the page list, but if the author includes pages in
# this file, it is assumed that the author will fully manage the
# pages section and SUSHI will not generate any page entries.
# The page file name is used as the key. If title is not provided,
# then the title will be generated from the file name.  If a
# generation value is not provided, it will be inferred from the
# file name extension.  Any subproperties that are valid filenames
# with supported extensions (e.g., .md/.xml) will be treated as
# sub-pages.

  index.md:
    title: Example Home

# The menu property will be used to generate the input/menu.xml file.
# The menu is represented as a simple structure where the YAML key
# is the menu item name and the value is the URL. The IG publisher
# currently only supports one level deep on sub-menus.
# To provide a custom menu.xml file, do not include this property and
# include a `menu.xml` file in input/includes.
# TO CONSIDER: If no menu data is provided, can we generate the menu
# based on the pages order or should we just generate a very standard
# menu (since there may be too many pages to fit in a menu).

  History: http://hl7.org/fhir/us/example/history.html

# The parameters property represents IG.definition.parameter. Rather
# than a list of code/value pairs (as in the ImplementationGuide
# resource), the code is the YAML key. If a parameter allows repeating
# values, the value in the YAML should be a sequence/array. For a
# partial list of allowed parameters see:
# https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Implementation+Guide+Parameters
parameters:
  excludettl: true
  validation: [allow-any-extensions, no-broken-links]

# The history property corresponds to package-list.json. SUSHI will
# use the existing top-level properties in its config to populate the
# top-level package-list.json properties: packageId, canonical, title,
# and introduction. Authors that wish to provide different values can
# supply them as properties under history. All other properties under
# history are assumed to be versions. To provide a custom package-list.json
# file, remove this property and include a package-list.json file in ig-data.
history:
  # The current version is special. If the author provides only a
  # single value, it is assumed to be the URL path to the current
  # build. The following default values will then be used:
  #   desc: Continuous Integration Build (latest in version control)
  #   status: ci-build
  #   current: true
  current: http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/example-ig/
  # All other versions need each of their values fully specified.
